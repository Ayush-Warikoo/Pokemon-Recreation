# Pokemon Recreation

## Description
I recreated a Pokemon-like game using object-oriented programming in Java and open-source graphical library and IDE, Processing.
In terms of controls, use the arrow keys to move the character around the map and click on buttons for all other actions. 

## Installing
* Requires Processing version 3.5.4 or higher
* Install necessary libraries by going to Sketch, Import Library, Add Library and then installing Minim and ControlP5

## Demo
### Start with a tutorial on the controls and plot of the game, as well as choosing your starter pokemon.

### Enter battle and choose between fighting, running, switching your pokemon or capturing the opposing pokemon.
